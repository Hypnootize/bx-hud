<a>INSTALLATION</a>
====

**1)** Extract/Unzip the hud

**2)** Copy the BX Hud folder (**NOT** BX-Hud-Master, the one inside it!)

**3)** Paste The folder to your custom tf folder (C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\custom\BX Hud)

**4)** Go to Resource/Fonts select all the font and install them (rightclick while selected and install)

**NOTES:**

I suggest using **"tf_hud_target_id_disable_floating_health" "1"** since the floating version is not as consistan and can have problems.

The original rgb code for the damage numbers is: hud_combattext_red 255; hud_combattext_green 150; hud_combattext_blue 0


<a>CROSSHAIRS</a>
====
All the hud crosshairs can be found inside the scripts/crosshairs folder!

It is possible to enable them from the crosshairs.res file by setting **"visible" "1"** for the wanted crosshair.

It is also possible to easily animate them so the crosshair turns red on damage by editing the HudAnimations_Crosshairs file, you can find all the instructions inside the file!
